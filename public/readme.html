Now, I'm at version 0.0.4 of this website!
There's one main thing I added this time: THEMES!
    - You can finally make, create, change and upload your themes!
    - Just press the theme button and enjoy!
    - Click the upload button to upload your theme
    - Click the download button to download the selected theme as a template
Some more additions: Ability to store data in the URL
    - This was unimplemented in the last release
    - Other minor improvements I forgot about. lol.
    - And minor internal code changes

Well, that's about it for this time!
But there's a lot of stuff that's yet to come, mainly settings :)
If you're waiting, please be patient as there's much to implement for a settings pane,
and implementing might take several weeks, I also need to find, and fix bugs as they come :)

Known issues:
    - Undo / Redo doesn't work (this one's fix won't be coming for a while lol)

Since this is a "large" release, I expect (at-least) some bugs to arise.
So if you find a bug, please contact <a href="mailto:user.some1@outlook.com">user.some1@outlook.com</a>,
with the title "Corul.ml/play bug found" (I may take a few days to see your email, and possibly reply)

And if you wanna have a look at the source code, it resides at:
    <a href="https://github.com/dquat/corul-web-app" target="_blank">https://github.com/dquat/corul-web-app</a>

If you wanna look at the current progress of the actual language, it resides at:

Now, go ahead and have fun <b>with themes</b>!
