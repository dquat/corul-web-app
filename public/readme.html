Well, looks like I'm at v0.0.3 of this website.
There's a hell lot of stuff I've changed this time!
    - UI (Can you guess which IDE it was inspired from?)
        - Layouts: Horizontal & Vertical!
        - Resizable tabs, which contain individual sections
        - Each section is like a mini HTML page :), Even this Readme!
        - When the UI gets smaller than 400 pixels wide or 400 pixels high,
          layout will be enforced to allow best viewing
    - Message quality (better messages, to help the user understand what's going on)
    - Now you can edit the name of each playground! Just head over to the project settings
      tab and change the name to whatever you like under 50 characters!
    - All playgrounds get deleted in 30 days, but if you load up your playground and click save,
      its timestamp will update, and your playground will last another 30 days from when you
      last updated!
    - If another playground exists with an exact same value, but different name, your playground
      won't be saved, and you'll be given the link of the other playground. This is done to reduce
      spam, although I don't really think *that* many people visit this website xD.
    - Several internal things, that don't really show up in the client side of things

Well, that's about it for this time!
But there's a lot of stuff that's yet to come :)

Known issues:
    - Undo / Redo doesn't work (this one's fix won't be coming for a while lol)

Since this is a "large" release, I expect (at-least) some bugs to arise.
So if you find a bug, please contact <a href="mailto:user.some1@outlook.com">user.some1@outlook.com</a>,
with the title "Corul.ml/play bug found" (I may take a few days to see your email, and possibly reply)
