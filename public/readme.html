Hello and welcome to version 0.0.8 of this website!
This version mainly includes a small introduction:
    - A getting started guide
And some features / improvements:
    - Added a new clear all button that clears the data stored in IndexedDB or LocalStorage. i.e. All cached user data that the playground uses to persist data on reload and browser sessions, can now be removed directly from the UI! (located in the project settings tab)
    - Slightly improved page load speed
    - Added line wrapping in readme
And a bug fix:
    - Fixed a bug that only accepts lowercase characters in the theme search bar
Note: Themes created prior to this release will <i><b>not</b></i> work!
And a new name, <b><u>Matriad</u></b>!

Well, that's about it for this time!

Known issues:
    - Undo / Redo doesn't work (this one's fix won't be coming for a while lol)
    - When pressing enter in editor, auto-scroll does not work (please help me fix this one ðŸ˜„)

If you find a bug, please contact <a href="mailto:user.some1@outlook.com">user.some1@outlook.com</a>, with the title "Matriad.ml/play bug found" (I may take a few days to see your email, and possibly reply)
