You can now change the:

    - Tab Size
    - Tab Type
    - Toggle option to show tabs and / or spaces
    - Toggle animations
    - Toggle Syntax Highlighting
    - Toggle Smooth Scrolling in the Editor (why would you do this...)

        - Yes. Danger Zone has moved from Project Settings to its own little section in the settings modal!

Minor bug? Fix where,
when 2 scrollbars appeared, a white, and annoying box would appear in the bottom right corner. This was especially annoying in dark mode. (Chromium only)

Note: Custom themes created before this release won't work.

Hopefully there's no bugs introduced in this release!

Well, that's about it for this time!

Known issues:
    - Undo / Redo doesn't work (this one's fix won't be coming for a while lol)
    - When pressing enter in editor, auto-scroll does not work (please help me fix this one ðŸ˜„)
