Hello and welcome to version 0.0.8 of this website!
This version mainly includes a small change / improvement:
    - A newly styled radio button
    - Scrollbar is now thin by default, unless unsupported by browsers


Well, that's about it for this time!

Known issues:
    - Undo / Redo doesn't work (this one's fix won't be coming for a while lol)
    - When pressing enter in editor, auto-scroll does not work (please help me fix this one ðŸ˜„)
