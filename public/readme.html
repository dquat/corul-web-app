Hello and welcome to version 0.0.7 of this website!
First things off, this was mostly a small feature, and bug fix release
    - Well. Turns out both the "bugs" I fixed, were not actually fixed :(
    - I, for sure, fixed one bug that was not fixed, now.
        - This one occurred when you just load the page, click on the theme button
          and click cancel, then an error would pop up. Now this bug has been fixed!
    - I added a new database to store your links in! Welcome, Firebase!
        - Hover over the database options in Project settings / Storage type to
          see each one's advantage and disadvantage!

Well, that's about it for this time!

Known issues:
    - Undo / Redo doesn't work (this one's fix won't be coming for a while lol)
