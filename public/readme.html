Hello and welcome to version 0.0.6 of this website!
First things off, this was mostly an aesthetic, and bug fix release
    - <s>2</s> 1 bug was fixed <s>(one partially fixed)</s>
        - The first bug fix was horrible. So I'm removing it.
        - <s>When pressing enter, the editor does not auto scroll.
             The fix works to some extent, then breaks. Again!</s>
        - A bug would occur when the theme loaded <i>after</i> the playground script loaded.
            - This has been fixed by using a nice loading screen to allow time for all the themes to load
              properly.
    - A few animations were added here and there to make the UX more pleasing!

Well, that's about it for this time!

Known issues:
    - Undo / Redo doesn't work (this one's fix won't be coming for a while lol)
