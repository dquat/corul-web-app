First off, this is the web editor for an unfinished, programming language which only has a lexer implemented so far.

This web app is only tested on Chromium and Firefox and only these browsers will be *almost* guaranteed to be supported. All other browsers do not get 100% support.
<h3 class="heading">1. The UI</h3>
<h4 class="heading">Section 1.1</h4>
Here, what you're reading is the contents of a "tab"
Right next to your tab, to the right or below (depending on your layout [section 1.2]), you will see a bar
This bar allows you to open, close and select specific tabs.
There are 5 tabs available in this bar:
    - Note: If you see less than 5 tabs, chances are your screen is too small to display all the tabs. In this case, an invisible scrollbar will appear, and you can scroll normally, even if you don't see a scrollbar.

    - Terminal
        - Unimplemented, but it is a to-be terminal for my language when you're going to be able to run it.

    - Notifications
        - This tab shows you any notifications that might be sent from the playground.
        - It will open automatically when a new notification is sent.
        - The new notification will be highlighted momentarily to help you identify it.
        - <b>Double clicking on a notification will remove it!</b>
        - <b>The Clear All button on the top of the notification tab will remove <u>all</u> of your notifications!</b>

    - Get Started
        - This tab you're reading right now, to help you get started with this playground!

    - Readme
        - Here you will see the latest release notes, i.e. what I changed in the specific "release"
        - You will also see the email I want you to send bugs / feature requests to.
        - Also, you will see the links for the repos of:
            - This web app you're currently viewing
            - The programming language I'm making

    - Project Settings
        - Here you will find options to change the playground name and playground storage options
            - Playground Name: Anything between 1-50 characters. If empty, a random name will be assigned for you
            - Playground Storage:
                - Database 1: The most tested, best for any size (long and short), and relatively fast database. Selected by default
                - Database 2: The newest database, and supposedly the fastest. Good for short or medium entries. Long entries untested.
                - Encoded URL: Stores the data in the URL. Anything above 2000 chars is not recommended, since the page won't load in some browsers, and will throw an error.
<h4 class="heading">Section 1.2</h4>
Depending on your layout settings and screen size, a layout is chosen:
    - Vertical
        - This tab is on the bottom, and the editor on top
    - Horizontal
        - This tab is on the right, and the editor on the left-hand side
<h4 class="heading">Section 1.3</h4>
Now, for the bar at the top.
Here, you will see 5 buttons, again:
    - The one to the far left, Run:
        - Will run the code. Currently, does nothing, since the language is unimplemented

    - The one next to it, with the link picture, Save:
        - Will save your "play" to either:
            - A database (db #1, or #2 depending on your choice)
            - Encoded URL

    - The next button is the layout button:
        - It is disabled on devices with screen width / height less than 400 pixels in size, and a layout for the best viewing will be picked for you automatically
        - On larger screens, clicking it will toggle the vertical or horizontal layouts
            - Vertical: Editor above, Tabs below
            - Horizontal: Editor to the left, Tabs to the right

    - The button right before the last one, to the far right is the theme button:
        - Clicking on this will open a modal with:
            - A search bar: Allows you to search for themes in the theme selector
            - A scrolling area with different theme options
            - A Cancel button: Deselects currently selected theme and uses previously selected theme.
            - An Ok button: Selects the theme. It will persist across browser sessions.
            - An Upload button: Uploads a theme you made!
            - A Download button: Downloads the currently selected theme as a template for you to craft your own themes!
        - Try it now! Open the theme modal, select a theme, and click Ok!

    - The last button, the settings button, Clicking this will open a modal where:
        - On the left are buttons that when clicked, will navigate to the appropriate section in the settings pane
        - The right side contains various settings you can tinker with. Mainly:
            - Tab Size: Change the tab size (number of characters a tab spans) of your tab character (default 4)
            - Use Spaces For Tabs: Use [Tab Size] number spaces instead of a tab character (default off)
            - Font Size: Change the size of the font (default 14)
            - Font Ligatures: Enable ligatures, some character combinations are changed by the font to enable better readability (default off)
            - Line Height: Distance between two lines in the Editor (default 1)
            - The rest are probably not going to be used much, but you can certainly explore their functions!
<h4 class="heading">Section 1.4</h4>
Notifications appear on the top when the settings pane or, the theme selector is open.
These notifications will also be available in the notifications tab
Otherwise, they normally appear in the notifications tab, and they autofocus the tab
<h4 class="heading">Section 1.5</h4>
Wondering what that pesky little bar between the editor and this tab is?
Well, it's a resize bar! Try it!
Click on it and resize the tab!
The size gets saved when tabs are closed, and opened, but not if you refresh.
Vertical size and Horizontal size is handled separately, so when you switch layouts, your layout's previous size will still be there!
<h4 class="heading">Section 1.6</h4>
Last, but not least, the Editor!
The editor will auto-save the contents, as you type!
It has basic syntax highlighting, currently, but more powerful highlighting will come in later releases!
